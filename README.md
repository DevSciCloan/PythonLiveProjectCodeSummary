**Create**
------
>[Story 2: Create your model]  
I created two models. One model contains all the Secret Santa groups that users can join. The second model contains information on each user profile that is created. The Person, i.e. user model, also contains a forgeign key to the Group model.

>[Story 3: Display all items from database]  
To display all the items from the database I decided to make a page where a user can see a list of all the members of their group. This is done by using Django tags to filter all users in the Person table from the database that have the same group ForeignKey.  

>[Story 4: Details page]  
My details page is found by clicking on the gear icon next to a user's name on the page that displays all members of a group.
